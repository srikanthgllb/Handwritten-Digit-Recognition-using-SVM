# Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset used is the digits dataset from the `sklearn` library, which contains 1797 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each represented as a 64-dimensional vector.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `sklearn.datasets.load_digits`
  - **Number of samples**: 1797
  - **Number of features**: 64
  - **Digit classes**: 0-9

- **Model**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Performance**: The SVM model is trained and evaluated to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.
